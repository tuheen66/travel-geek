        "long_description": "Bali is a place that screams sybaritic splendor and Edenic bliss all at once. Of the thousands of islands in the Indonesian archipelago, the best beaches in Bali are undoubtedly the most visited. Seamlessly blending calm with the spiritual and a dose of fun, Bali’s best beaches (pantai in Bahasa Indonesia) speak for itself. Together with the soft-sand beaches, the Indian Ocean's kaleidoscopic haze of blues and greens has seduced travelers from all around–from honeymooners and digital nomads to families and friends–making it all the more reason to protect it when visiting.\n\nAlthough it may be tempting to hole up in your dreamy villa, the beaches of Bali have a certain allure and before you know it, you'll have spent the day lazing on the sand with a Bintang or fresh coconut in hand. So without further ado, these are the eight best beaches in Bali.\n\nWhich coast of Bali has the best beaches?\nThis depends on what you’re after. The party scenes in beach clubs lean to the south–Seminyak, Jimbaran and Canggu beaches are the buzziest corners. Surfers gravitate towards the southwest and east coasts for the big-league waves where Uluwatu and Nusa Dua boast some gnarly surf breaks. The northeastern side has glimmering black sands that are hidden gems for those craving some stillness and most resorts have their own well-manicured, private beaches with some offering day passes for non-guests.\nWhen is the best time to go to the beach in Bali?\nEarly in the morning, just after sunrise, is the best time to visit the beach since it is quieter, the air is cooler, and the humidity is more bearable. The southern part of the island is the most developed, with cafes, bars, and shops lining the streets, so beaches can be packed during the daytime.",

        "long_description": "The Alpine region of Switzerland, conventionally referred to as the Swiss Alps, represents a major natural feature of the country and is, along with the Swiss Plateau and the Swiss portion of the Jura Mountains, one of its three main physiographic regions. The Swiss Alps extend over both the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps, encompassing an area sometimes called Central Alps.While the northern ranges from the Bernese Alps to the Appenzell Alps are entirely in Switzerland, the southern ranges from the Mont Blanc massif to the Bernina massif are shared with other countries such as France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein.\n\nThe Swiss Alps comprise almost all the highest mountains of the Alps, such as Dufourspitze (4,634 m), the Dom (4,545 m), the Liskamm (4,527 m), the Weisshorn (4,506 m) and the Matterhorn (4,478 m). The other following major summits can be found in this list of mountains of Switzerland.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, transit across the Alps played an important role in history. The region north of St Gotthard Pass became the nucleus of the Swiss Confederacy in the early 14th century.\n\nGeography\nThe Alps cover 60% of Switzerland's total 41,285 square kilometres (15,940 sq mi) surface area, making it one of the most alpine countries. Despite the fact that Switzerland covers only 14% of the Alps total 192,753 square kilometres (74,422 sq mi) area, 48 out of 82 alpine four-thousanders are located in the Swiss Alps and practically all of the remaining 34 are within 20 kilometres (12 mi) of the country's border.\n\nThe glaciers of the Swiss Alps cover an area of 1,220 square kilometres (470 sq mi) — 3% of the Swiss territory, representing 44% of the total glaciated area in the Alps i.e. 2,800 square kilometres (1,100 sq mi).\n\nThe Swiss Alps are situated south of the Swiss Plateau and north of the national border. The limit between the Alps and the plateau runs from Vevey on the shores of Lake Geneva to Rorschach on the shores of Lake Constance, passing close to the cities of Thun and Lucerne. The not well defined regions in Switzerland that lie on the margin of the Alps, especially those on the north side, are called the Swiss Prealps (Préalpes in French, Voralpen in German, Prealpi in Italian). The Swiss Prealps are mainly made of limestone and they generally do not exceed 2,500 metres (8,200 ft).\n\nThe Alpine cantons (from highest to lowest) are Valais, Bern, Graubünden, Uri, Glarus, Ticino, St. Gallen, Vaud, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Schwyz, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Fribourg, Lucerne and Zug. The countries with which Switzerland shares mountain ranges of the Alps are (from west to east): France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein.\n",

The ancient records known as the Honchō getsurei (本朝月令) and Nenchūgyōji hissho (年中行事秘抄) reveal that a succession of disastrous rains with high winds ruined the grain crops, and epidemics had spread through the country. Because diviners placed the cause on divine punishment by the Kamo deities, the Emperor sent his messenger with a retinue to the shrine to conduct various acts to appease the deities, in prayer for a bountiful harvest. These included riding a galloping horse.[1]\n\nThis became an annual ritual, and the galloping horse performance developed into an equestrian archery performance. According to the historical record known as the Shoku Nihongi (続日本記, so many people had come to view this equestrian performance on the festival day in the 2nd year of the reign of Emperor Monmu (r. 697–707) that the event was banned.[1]\n\nIn the ninth century, Emperor Kanmu established the seat of the imperial throne in Kyoto. This represented the beginning of the Heian period in Japanese history. Emperor Kanmu recognized the deities of the Kamo shrines as protectors of the Heian capital, and established the Aoi Matsuri as an annual imperial event.[2",

        "long_description": "The Serengeti ecosystem is a geographical region in Africa, spanning the Mara and Arusha Regions of Tanzania. The protected area within the region includes approximately 30,000 km2 (12,000 sq mi) of land, including the Serengeti National Park and several game reserves. The Serengeti hosts the second largest terrestrial mammal migration in the world, which helps secure it as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa.The Serengeti is also renowned for its large lion population and is one of the best places to observe prides in their natural environment. Approximately 70 large mammal and 500 bird species are found there. This high diversity is a function of diverse habitats, including riverine forests, swamps, kopjes, grasslands, and woodlands. Blue wildebeest, gazelles, zebras, and buffalos are some of the commonly found large mammals in the region.The Serengeti also contains the Serengeti District of Tanzania.The name \"Serengeti\" is often said to be derived from the word \"seringit\" in the Maasai language, Maa, meaning \"endless plains\".However, this etymology does not appear in Maa dictionaries.\n\nHistory\nFor eons, Serengeti was sparsely inhabited as species of African wildlife have roamed freely across the vast rolling plains. However, this changed when nomadic pastoralists of the Maasai began to migrate to the area in the early 19th century.\n\nThey were hurt by drought and disease. Thousands died in the 1880s from a cholera epidemic and in 1892 from smallpox. Rinderpest (a bovine viral disease) then wiped out the cattle which were their possessions. Later in the 20th century the Tanzanian government re-settled the Maasai around the Ngorongoro Crater. Poaching, and the absence of fires (which had been caused by humans), allowed dense woodlands and thickets to develop over the next 30–50 years. Tsetse fly populations now prevented any significant human settlement in the area.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, wildebeest and Cape buffalo populations had recovered and were increasingly cropping the grass, reducing the amount of fuel available for fires. The reduced intensity of fires has allowed acacia to once again become established.\n\nIn the 21st century, mass rabies vaccination programmes for domestic dogs in the Serengeti have not only indirectly prevented hundreds of human deaths, but also protected wildlife species such as the endangered African wild dog.\n\nGreat migration\n\nMigrating wildebeest.\n\nWildebeest crossing the river during the Serengeti migration.\nEach year around the same time, the circular great wildebeest migration begins in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area of the southern Serengeti in Tanzania and loops clockwise through the Serengeti National Park and north towards the Masai Mara reserve in Kenya. This migration is naturally caused, by the availability of grazing. The initial phase lasts from about January to March, when the calving season begins – a time when there is plenty of rain-ripened grass available for the 260,000 zebras that precede 1.7 million wildebeest and the following hundreds of thousands of other plains game, including around 470,000 gazelles.\n\nDuring February, the wildebeest are on the short grass plains of the southeast part of the ecosystem, grazing and giving birth to approximately 500,000 calves in 2 to 3 weeks. Few calves are born ahead of time and of these, hardly any survive, largely because very young calves are more noticeable to predators when mixed with older calves from the previous year. As the rains end in May, the animals start moving northwest into the areas around the Grumeti River, where they typically remain until late June. The crossings of the Grumeti and Mara rivers beginning in July are a popular safari attraction because crocodiles are lying in wait. The herds arrive in Kenya in late July / August, where they stay for the rest of the dry season, except that the Thomson's and Grant's gazelles move only east/west. In early November, with the start of the short rains, the migration starts moving south again, to the short grass plains of the southeast, usually arriving in December in plenty of time for calving in February.\n\nAbout 250,000 wildebeest die during the journey from Tanzania to the Maasai Mara National Reserve in southwestern Kenya, a total of 800 kilometres (500 mi). Death is usually from thirst, hunger, exhaustion, or predation, including by big cats.\n",

        "short_description": "Step back in time and explore the ancient Colosseum of Rome",
        "long_description": "The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).\n\nThe Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history, having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.\n\nAlthough substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is still a renowned symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit \"Way of the Cross\" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum. The Colosseum is depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin.\nHistory\nConstruction, inauguration, and Roman renovations\n\nSestertius of Titus celebrating the inauguration of the Colosseum (minted 80 AD).\n\nA map of central Rome during the Roman Empire, with the Colosseum at the upper right corner\nThe site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills, through which a canalised stream ran as well as an artificial lake/marsh. By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited. It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain. He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes. The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea.\n\n\nCross-section from the Lexikon der gesamten Technik (1904)\nAlthough the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre. Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea. Vespasian's decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre, in effect, placing it both symbolically and geographically at the heart of Rome.\n\nConstruction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the First Jewish–Roman War in 70 AD led to the Siege of Jerusalem. According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, \"the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty.\" It is often assumed that Jewish prisoners of war were brought back to Rome and contributed to the massive workforce needed for the construction of the amphitheatre, but there is no ancient evidence for that; it would, nonetheless, be commensurate with Roman practice to add humiliation to the defeated population. Along with this free source of unskilled labor, teams of professional Roman builders, engineers, artists, painters and decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum. The Colosseum was constructed with several different materials: wood, limestone, tuff, tiles, cement, and mortar.\n",

The number of inhabited islands is variously cited as between 166 and 227.\n\nThe largest Greek island by both area and population is Crete, located at the southern edge of the Aegean Sea. The second largest island in area is Euboea or Evvia, which is separated from the mainland by the 60m-wide Euripus Strait, and is administered as part of the Central Greece region. After the third and fourth largest Greek islands, Lesbos and Rhodes, the rest of the islands are two-thirds of the area of Rhodes, or smaller.\n\nThe Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters: the Argo-Saronic Islands in the Saronic Gulf near Athens; the Cyclades, a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea; the North Aegean islands, a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey; the Dodecanese, another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey; the Sporades, a small tight group off the coast of Euboea; and the Ionian Islands, chiefly located to the west of the mainland in the Ionian Sea. Crete with its surrounding islets and Euboea are traditionally excluded from this grouping.\n\nThis article excludes the Peloponnese, which has technically been an island since the construction of the Corinth Canal in 1893, but is rarely considered to be an island due to its artificial origins.\nMykonos, Santorini, Crete, Skiathos, Rhodes, Kefalonia, Zakynthos: from one end of the sea to the other, the Greek islands are the perfect holiday destination. It’s not just the emerald water and the idyllic beaches that make holidays on the Greek islands a world-famous holiday experience. It’s not only the bright light that floods the sea and sky, or the elegant architecture and pure nature. It’s the very personal relationship you can have with your chosen island that puts a seal of perfection on these little Greek oases.\n\nA romantic sunset in Santorini’s Oia, painting the horizon every shade of pink...dawn on Mykonos, in Little Venice, drinking, dancing and flirting as the sun comes up... the epitome of luxury with a view of the sea from your opulent suite in Elounda, on Crete... travelling back in time, as you walk through Rhodes’ Old Town and aristocratic Corfu... a stately excursion to Athens’ smaller, nearby islands in the Argosaronic Gulf (Hydra, Spetses, Aegina, Poros)... an expedition off the beaten track where you’ll discover hidden ‘diamonds’, islands like Anafi, Kimolos and Kastelorizo, Symi, Alonissos, Samothrace and Paxi.\n\nYou’ll be drawn into an ecstatic wanderlust, eager to discover all the glories of the Aegean Greek islands:  the famous Cyclades with their whitewashed towns, the Lesser Cyclades and the Dodecanese, where you’ll encounter islands blanketed in green, small paradises of luxury (Patmos, Symi) and thriving tradition (Kalymnos, Karpathos, Astypalaia).\n\nAdd to the mix, the smiles of the locals, the hospitality and the culinary delights of the Mediterranean diet, spice it up with adventures in nature, in the deep, on the waves and on the mountains and you’ll find that discovering the Greek islands makes the best holidays of your life.\n",

        "long_description": "There’s no feeling quite like stepping ashore in South Georgia to be among hundreds of thousands of King penguins. The most striking and brightly colored of the penguins, kings are second in size to the emperor and sport a beautiful yellow-orange throat patch, an orange, inverted teardrop-shaped marking on either side of their black heads, and long, curved elegant beaks. Since they form breeding colonies on subantarctic islands and not sea ice, king penguins can spread their breeding season over a much longer time, between 14 and 16 months. They also spend a much longer time raising and caring for their chicks. Like emperors, kings do not build nests but incubate their eggs on their feet, keeping them warm under a feathery fold of skin. Both parents take turns incubating for periods of 1 to 2 ½ weeks while the other goes off to hunt. Chicks have fluffy brown plumage until about a year old when they acquire their adult feathers and coloring. They look so different from their parents that juveniles were once thought to be a different species. And sailors christened them “oakum boys” because the. brown plumage reminded them of the color of oakum used to caulk timbers on sailing ships. The Emperor penguin, the largest of all penguin species, commands attention with its size and presence. Standing at an impressive height of about 1.2 meters (4 feet), these magnificent birds possess a sleek, streamlined body perfectly adapted for life in the icy Antarctic. Their iconic black and white plumage, coupled with a bright yellow patch on their necks, creates a striking visual contrast against the snowy backdrop. Emperors are well-known for their incredible endurance, braving the harshest conditions with temperatures plummeting to -50 degrees Celsius (-58 degrees Fahrenheit) and fierce winds exceeding 100 kilometers per hour (62 miles per hour). Unlike all other penguins, which nest on land, emperors make their colonies on the sea ice, likely never once stepping foot on land.  These incredible swimmers dive deeper and longer than any other bird, up to 700 feet, and can stay underwater for 18 minutes as they hunt crustaceans, squid, and fish.",

The region comprises the southern section of the Andes Mountains with lakes, fjords, temperate rainforests, and glaciers in the west and deserts, tablelands and steppes to the east. Patagonia is bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and many bodies of water that connect them, such as the Strait of Magellan, the Beagle Channel, and the Drake Passage to the south.The Colorado and Barrancas rivers, which run from the Andes to the Atlantic, are commonly considered the northern limit of Argentine Patagonia. The archipelago of Tierra del Fuego is sometimes included as part of Patagonia. Most geographers and historians locate the northern limit of Chilean Patagonia at Huincul Fault, in Araucanía Region. At the time of the Spanish arrival, Patagonia was inhabited by multiple indigenous tribes. In a small portion of northwestern Patagonia, indigenous peoples practiced agriculture, while in the remaining territory, peoples lived as hunter-gatherers, traveling by foot in eastern Patagonia or by dugout canoe and dalca in the fjords and channels. In colonial times indigenous peoples of northeastern Patagonia adopted a horseriding lifestyle. While the interest of the Spanish Empire had been chiefly to keep other European powers away from Patagonia, independent Chile and Argentina began to colonize the territory slowly over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries. This process brought a decline of the indigenous populations, whose lives and habitats were disrupted, while at the same time thousands of Europeans, Argentines, Chilotes and mainland Chileans settled in Patagonia. Border disputes between Argentina and Chile were recurrent in the 20th century.[citation needed] The contemporary economy of eastern Patagonia revolves around sheep farming and oil and gas extraction, while in western Patagonia fishing, salmon aquaculture, and tourism dominate. Culturally, Patagonia has a varied heritage, including Criollo, Mestizo, Indigenous, German, Croat, Italian, English, Scot, and Welsh influences.",

We aimed to explore the area at our own pace, hike to hidden places, and fully immerse ourselves in the experience. We spent an entire day in Petra, from early morning until sunrise, and had the opportunity to interact with locals, which was incredibly rewarding.To help others have a similar experience, we would like to offer some advice and information on what to know before visiting the Lost City of Petra. While plenty of information is available online, we want to provide additional insights we discovered during our travels. You can refer to the table of contents to find the sections that interest you the most. The Ancient City of Petra has a long and fascinating history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to prehistoric times. However, it was during the Nabatean period that Petra reached the peak of its wealth and cosmopolitanism. The Nabateans established Petra as their capital city in 312 BC, and it flourished until 100 AD when the Romans invaded and took control. For centuries, Petra remained largely unknown to the western world, until the Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt stumbled upon the site in 1812. Burckhardt’s discovery brought international attention to Petra, and it soon became recognized as one of the world’s most remarkable archaeological wonders. In 1985, Petra was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it has since become Jordan’s most-visited tourist attraction. The site’s breathtaking natural beauty, coupled with its rich cultural heritage, continues to attract visitors from all over the world.",

About 250 cherry trees line the 1.4-kilometer promenade in the Sewaritei District. Gaze at the petals from spacious lawn areas or from a 25-meter-high viewing post. Go higher still by scaling the nearby cherry tree-covered Mount Otokoyama to visit the Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine. This lesser-known World Heritage Site is famous for omuro sakura cherry trees, which are said to be the latest blooming cherries in the whole of Kyoto. The forest of these trees in the inner grounds reaches a height of only about two to three meters, bringing the blossoms closer to the ground for great portrait shots.You will also find trees of the mainstream somei yoshino variety in front of the main hall and weeping cherry trees near the bell tower. During the Edo period, the night viewing of cherry blossoms at this shrine became famous throughout Japan, and the tradition continues today. Its grounds feature a mind-blowing array of cherry varieties, totaling about 60 types among 400 trees.he early-blooming nature of the sakigake variety that originated at the shrine led to the old saying that when it starts to blossom, then the cherry-viewing season in the capital has begun. The later-blooming trees here extend the blossom parties through to mid-April. One of the most popular and pleasing of Kyoto’s cherry blossom spots is Philosopher’s Path, a stone pathway that runs alongside a canal lined with hundreds of cherry trees. The roughly two-kilometer route begins around Ginkaku-ji (the Silver Pavilion) and ends near Nanzen-ji Temple at the southern end. Step into the sumptuous garden here and you’ll soon be enveloped in a canopy of cherry blossoms. The 30,000-square meter garden is a nationally designated site of scenic beauty famous for its weeping cherry trees— most of which were planted back when the shrine was created in 1895. Be sure to visit the east garden for views of more blossoms reflected in Seiho Lake. For blossom viewing on a grand scale, head to the Arashiyama region, where cherry trees turn the eponymous mountain a patchwork of pink and green. This view, with the Togetsukyo bridge in the foreground, is one of the most famous vistas in Japan.Cherry trees also line the Katsuragawa river and more can be found in Nakanoshima Park on the western riverbank.

Just a 15-minute air-conditioned speedboat ride from the international airport, it’s the country’s first multi-island leisure and lifestyle destination, designed to target both international tourists and locals looking for a day escape from the capital.Arriving guests pull into a picturesque 30-berth marina – where they’re likely to spot a superyacht or two – that connects to an open-air dining and retail zone. From there, they’re shuttled via electric buggy to one of two resorts – the SAii Lagoon Maldives, Curio Collection by Hilton or the Hard Rock Hotel Maldives – which occupy their own individual islands, all connected by narrow bridges. Daytrippers can head for the SAii Beach Club, a separate venue with its own private beach and dining options.",

        "long_description": "Vibrant Mauritius, a volcanic island nation surrounded by the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, is a paradise for sun, beach, water sport and cultural enthusiasts.This spectacular destination is home to around 700 plant species, rare birds such as the pink pigeon and kestrel as well as a myriad marine species that make scuba diving and snorkelling one of the country’s most renowned activities.Visit Grand Baie, a shopping and leisure mecca, the Balaclava Ruins just a stone’s throw away from the Baie aux Tortues (named by 17th century sailors due to the many tortoises in the area), immerse yourself in the hustle and bustle of the Flacq Market (the country’s largest open-air market), lounge on the most beautiful beach in Mauritius – the Ile aux Cerfs and discover the Black River Gorges. Mauritius has an adventure for all. As the balmy, scented breeze cuts through the taxi's open window, our driver Nawaz asks: 'Can you smell that?' He's talking about the sweet aroma drifting from the lush sugarcane fields. The sugar industry has fuelled Mauritius' economy for more than three centuries and continues to play an important role, both in exports and tourism. We pass hotels set in historic sugar plantations, signs for rum distilleries advertising tours and tastings, and, later, as the sun dissolves into the Indian Ocean, we join fellow holidaymakers at a rustic-chic beach bar sipping mango mojitos, coconut daiquiris and other heady cocktails powered by the island's rum. Blessed with a subtropical climate - it's on the same latitude as Queensland's Airlie Beach and Hawaii - Mauritius hits the sweet spot for visitors year-round. We're here as February blends into March, when it's hot and humid, but not cloyingly so. Regular short, sharp downpours leave the air refreshed and infused with an earthy tang, when tiny, adorable birds, like the red-breasted fody and the bulbul - which sports a punk rocker-like hairdo - chirp by rain-dappled hibiscus and frangipani. Gorgeous gardens pepper Mauritius, including at our all-inclusive, family-friendly north-coast base, Club Med La Pointe aux Canonniers, which marks its 50th birthday this year, but flaunts a smart, pre-pandemic makeover. Manicured lawns hedge spruced-up pool and dining areas, where tastebud-pleasing dishes reflect the cosmopolitan make-up of Mauritius, an island nation shaped by its past as a French, then British colony, and waves of immigration from Africa and Asia. We devour fragrant curries, biryanis and rougailles (stews), grilled fish and seafood, sushi and sashimi, and desserts ranging from Parisian-esque patisserie to tamarind ice cream and rum-soaked banana flambe.",
